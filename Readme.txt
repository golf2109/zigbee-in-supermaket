Folders and it's means :
   \cashier	: project for cashier
   \client		: project for client
   \router		: project for coordinator & router
   \FrameWork	: framework of all code

Compile and run project:
  1. Check out all projects (cashier or client)
  2. Install Zstack (becacause Zstack is too big ~70MB so i dont upload it).
  3. Copy projects to Texas Instruments\ZStack-CC2530\Projects\zstack\Samples. Run project and try compile.
  4. When change code, just need commit source (file *.c and *.h) at folder \cashier\source\
